# Distance between two points on sphere

To calculate distance I have used [haversian formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula).


##Steps to setup project:

1. Install virtual environment for the project using
[virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/).

2. Inside virtual environment install dependencies:
`pip install requirements.txt`

3. Run program from command line using: `python source/main.py`

4. To run all test cases: `pytest` (optional)
